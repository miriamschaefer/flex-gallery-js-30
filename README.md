# Flex Gallery

Exercise 5/30, part of the [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

Used this exercise to keep on practicing my Javascript skills. In this particular exercise, the main goal is to practice the CSS property `flexbox` and the Javascript `transitionend` event. Also, got to know the `propertyName` check using the array method `includes()` and using `>` as a child combinator on my CSS.

- Javascript Vanilla.
