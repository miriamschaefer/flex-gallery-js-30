# Flex Gallery 🎨

Exercise 5/30, part of the [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

Used this exercise to keep on practicing my Javascript skills. In this particular exercise, the main goal is to practice the CSS property `flexbox` and got to work with the `propertyName` check using the array method `includes()` and using `>` as a child combinator on my CSS. Even though this is the way the tutorial stated, I finally decided to go just for one function that toggles both CSS classes with transitions at the same time, as if we use the `transitionend` event, it will be automatically triggered by the window when loading and the effect will be messed.

- Javascript Vanilla.
- CSS3
